Mora A, Rolo A, Molina RA, Mora C (2023) The SheetPot: a new pot that overcomes several shortcomings of seedling production



This pot system is part of the developments of the Carbon Neutraility project. A citizen-science initative, in which individuals calculate their carbon footprint, the number of trees needed to offset those emmisions and then plant the trees. We have manage to plant up to 10,000 trees in two hours by 2,000 volunteers.

However, due to the lack of maintenance after plantining, we relay in the use use of healthy seedlings to maximize survival. "Healthy" characteristics include seedlings with no root bounding, tall enough to escape above-ground competition with weeds, deep roots to gain fast access to the water table and avoid below-ground weed root competition, while grown in a pot system that reduces planting shock. While many types of pots are commercially available, commonly they do not satisfy all the criteria above, and if they, they are often not cheap. Here we describe a set of pot prototypes that achive the criteria above while being affordable.

Our first version of the pot sytem was made out of paper, and the internet is full of DYI examples.

The idea here is that seedlings can be grown in a paper pot, and put directly in the ground avoiding problems of planting shock when removing the seedling from the pots. We contacted numerous suppliers in the USA and China, and used numerous materials and types of coatings.

However, problems apepared rapidaly. Firts, paper decomposed fast, and; second, pots stock to each other when on contact at the nursery

We developed a tray with the expectation that keeping the pots separate could elongate the duration of the paper pot, while avoiding contacts that casued them to stick with each other.

This idea, was a nightmate. The paper suffered from decomposition, and while some papers lasted longer, they rarely exceed two months. The paper decomposing fast caused the soil to erode,  exposing the root sytems and causing a major stress to the seedling evidenced by the fact that they rarely grew.



We then move to non-wovem bags, and we found a Chinesse manufrcature that made the bags at 3cent per bags... seedlings really loved these bags.

There were however, two major problems. Firt, the bags were difficult to fill and the roots crossed from bag to bag when in contact. For the second problem, we created a tray, and it worked pretty good.

However, overcoming problem two was more difficult. We try numerous filling mechanisms, but they were still hard to implement. Filling this bags was very labor intensive and slow.

Then, the idea occured to us of using nets as pots...the idea here is that one can create a roll with the net, creating a cylinder that can be used as pot. We used the tray developed above. At first we used ckiked plastic fencing

They worked well, in the sense that they kept the shape, but soil eroded as the holes were too large. SO we used mostiquito nets.

Once the design was tested in the lab, we searched numerous mnusfacturers, of which those located in China provided the best deals. The mold cost $200, and each sheet at 0.5 mm cost $0.30 cents. The price per sheet can be cost by more than half with thinner materials, which have not been tested.
