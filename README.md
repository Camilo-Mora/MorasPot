# MORA's Pot


 
Healthy seedlings are key to the success of large-scale restoration. "Healthy" characteristics include seedlings with no root bounding, tall enough to escape above-ground competition with weeds, deep roots to gain fast access to the water table and avoid below-ground weed root competition, while grown in a pot system that reduces planting shock. While many types of pots are commercially available, commonly they do not satisfy all the criteria above, and if close, they are often not cheap. Here we describe several attempts to develop a pot that fits all the criteria above while being affordable.
