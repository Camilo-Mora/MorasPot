Mora A, Rollo A, Molina RA, Mora C (2023) The SheetPot: a new pot that overcomes several shortcomings of seedling production



This pot system is part of the developments of the Carbon Neutraility project. A citizen-science initative, in which individuals calculate their carbon footprint, the number of trees needed to offset those emmisions and then plant the trees. We have manage to plant up to 10,000 trees in two hours by 2,000 volunteers.

However, due to the lack of maintenance after plantining, we relay in the use use of healthy seedlings to maximize survival. "Healthy" characteristics include seedlings with no root bounding, tall enough to escape above-ground competition with weeds, deep roots to gain fast access to the water table and avoid below-ground weed root competition, while grown in a pot system that reduces planting shock. While many types of pots are commercially available, commonly they do not satisfy all the criteria above, and if they, they are often not cheap. Here we describe a set of pot prototypes that achive the criteria above while being affordable.

Our first version of the pot sytem was made out of paper, and the internet is full of DYI examples.

The idea here is that seedlings can be grown in a paper pot, and put directly in the ground avoiding problems of planting shock when removing the seedling from the pots. We contacted numerous suppliers in the USA and China, and used numerous materials and types of coatings.

However, problems apepared rapidaly. Firts, paper decomposed fast, and; second, pots stock to each other when on contact at the nursery

</p>


We developed a tray with the expectation that keeping the pots separate could elongate the duration of the paper pot, while avoiding contacts that casued them to stick with each other.

</p>

This idea, was a nightmate. The paper suffered from decomposition, and while some papers lasted longer, they rarely exceed two months. The paper decomposing fast caused the soil to erode,  exposing the root sytems and causing a major stress to the seedling evidenced by the fact that they rarely grew.



We then move to non-wovem bags, and we found a Chinesse manufrcature that made the bags at 3cent per bags... seedlings really loved these bags.

</p>


There were however, two major problems. Firt, the bags were difficult to fill and the roots crossed from bag to bag when in contact. For the second problem, we created a tray, and it worked pretty good.

</p>

However, overcoming problem two was more difficult. We try numerous filling mechanisms, but they were still hard to implement. Filling this bags was very labor intensive and slow.

Then, the idea occured to us of using nets as pots...the idea here is that one can create a roll with the net, creating a cylinder that can be used as pot. We used the tray developed above. At first we used ckiked plastic fencing

This mesh pots worked well, in the sense that they kept the shape, but soil eroded as the holes were too large. SO we used mostiquito nets, instead.

They really worked like a charm: soil did not erode, there was full on oxygenation, not water perch, the sedling could be exely removed by simply unlooing the net, they were re-usable forever, very cheap to transports and we even found a Chinesse manufacturer to make then at $30 cents per unit. It looked like we have our winner. But not quite. The problem that they need for a try... and the problem we have we our current tray is that it was too bulky which the thier fabriation and cost of shipping expesive.

<br>
At this stage, the tray was fullfiling a few requiremments: 1) keeping seedlings spaced, 2) keeping the shape of the net rolls, and 3) facilitating transportation of the seedlings. In reality of all this fucntions only fucntion 2 required a tall tray. So we figure out a way to move that fucntion to the pot, and make a smaller tray. Introducing our Mora's Pot:

As shown above it is a plastic sheet, that can be rolled and locked in place. Not to say that it was the first design that occured to us. In fact, we try many:

Alternative usage witouht the locking mechanism:

Holes on the sheet was be configurated in many form to affect oxygen exchange, irrigation, water loging, drying, etc. We recomend to use UV protection to maximie the life usage of the sheets. While we used 0.5mm thick sheets, we have noted that they can be just as good with much thineer materials, even as thin as a paper sheet, which will reduce cost for parts and shipping considerably.

Once the design was tested in the lab, we searched numerous mnusfacturers, of which those located in China provided the best deals. The mold cost $200, and each sheet of 5 mm thickness cost $0.30 cents. The price per sheet can be reduced by more than half with thinner materials, which have not been tested.

Our die cut was manufactured by JinJiang Jiaxing Group Co.,Limited (contact person Tony : sales37@jiaxing-groups.com and service18@jiaxing-groups.com). You are welome to contact them directly and ask to use our mold.


The file needed by the manufacturer is called: MorasPot in this repository. We provided it in different file formats, but the PDF will satisfy in most cases.
